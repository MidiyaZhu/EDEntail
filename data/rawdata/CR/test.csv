"you can also slow a song down speed it up , which is cool too",positive
we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully,positive

"i don 't believe this camera is still available but if you can find one , you might like to get it",positive
3 it never smelled at all,positive
it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk,positive

the entire unit was poorly crafted,negative

i then realized a major design flaw,negative
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version,negative
the vibrate setting is loud !,negative
i 'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable,negative
imagine my shock and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex,negative

this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files just subscription wma files,negative
the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on,negative
player has a problem with dual layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2,negative
cons no am fm radio tuner something a large number of compete tors are doing,negative
after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem,negative
1 your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism,negative
"again , this is a design flaw in the headphone !",negative
what a disappointment !,negative
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted maybe 10 seconds of wait,negative
"4 the zen stores data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched )",negative
"i did n 't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out",negative

i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work,negative
they obviously have quality and reliability problems,negative
"this isn 't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine",negative
do not buy any home version of norton anything,negative
"they said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping 15 to handle and ship a cd ? and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails",negative
"like most of their solutions ( which first blame other applications for errors ) , the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error it was not",negative
1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days ),negative
"the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera",negative
"in any case , navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders",negative
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient,negative
1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera,negative
"i took my zen micro with me over the weekend , and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason to keep the zen micro charged",negative
"otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward",negative
"the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10 or so",negative
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual,negative
buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks,negative
even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast,negative
t mobile wasn 't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate,negative
"headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature",negative
the interface used could be better designed,negative
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times,negative
"after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 of the dvds i put in it",negative
"in addition , i don 't believe that it is odorless",negative
it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it,negative
"remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons",negative
then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not,negative
i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose,negative
the buttons are rather stiff,negative
no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking,negative
video recording is limited at just 9 seconds,negative
the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rp ms of the speed settings were mentioned,negative
the internet connection would go down every 5 mins when i used it with a p2p program called bit spirit,negative
one complaint the screen is too easily scratched !,negative
the creative software is awkward difficult to use and just plain does n 't load on some computers,negative
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped,negative
seems the program scan feature did not find the exe file for outlook !,negative
it 's not as stylized as a sony or samsung,negative
"the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect",negative
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mils ( real estate broker software ) very well at all,negative
i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience,negative
hard drive screws up occasionally,negative
"if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way !",negative
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated,negative
"the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered , and excludes my favorite feature in itunes , the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder",negative
"third , the poor design continues with the case",negative
"weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does n 't show the complete file names of mp3s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1 2x , etc ) before getting back to normal size sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly",negative
4 ) no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras,negative
a bit disappoint on that !,negative
looks and durability i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface,negative
"as i wrote , this could have been a great product , but expect hidden charges ( read gross profiteering and price gouging ) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage",negative
do n 't buy this player,negative
"if you buying this player to use with napster to go , wait a while",negative
the only disappointment so far has been battery life,negative
"second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed",negative
"this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks",negative
"when you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the numerous features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability this is a phone that isn 't easy to out grow",negative
the top did not fit well into the unit ( felt defective ),negative
"unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming",negative
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t mobile,negative
screen review could be better,negative
opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it,negative
"and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control",negative
"the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music , or copy large files over the local network",negative
"respectable , solid , but not awe inspiring",negative
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n 't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked,negative
"the player kept displaying no disc , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as !",negative
"it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman",negative
"although , i thought it could 've been designed a bit better",negative
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on off button,negative
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder,negative
mine generally requires a charge every 48 hours or so and i don 't really talk on it that much,negative
"the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid",negative
"i have overall been disappointed with nokia in the past , finding that samsung and motorola tended to have better quality phones",negative
we resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the diaper champ for wet diapers only,negative
"there is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 gb photo ipod , but it costs 20 more",negative
why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20gb ipod that will hold 4 times the number of songs ( and even more if aac encoding is used ) for the same price ? ? ?,negative
"this time , it started the installation process , then i left for work i think it will work i hope it will work",negative
but be prepared to buy something else ( diaper genie ? ) which can trap the odor better,negative
only downside is when taking pictures in low light conditions without the flash,negative
the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half,negative
it would not hang up on calls,negative
2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called unknown,negative
