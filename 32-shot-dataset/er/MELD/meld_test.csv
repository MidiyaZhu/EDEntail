Like me tiny doctor!,anger
"Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",sadness
"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along.",anger

"Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.",noemo
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?,surprise
"The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you?",anger
"Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.",anger
And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?,sadness
"I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion!",anger

"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.",anger
"Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it  look like?!",surprise
I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of  it.,anger
